        has normal blood flow, and
        has exercise-induced ST depression of 0.6, and
        has a cholesterol level of 141 mg/dl.

        has a resting blood pressure of 138 mm/HG, and
        is male.
    Dra. Lee  said that patient93 is fresh like a daisy, because
        has normal blood flow, and
        has non-anginal pain, and
        has a maximum heart rate of 175, and
        has exercise-induced ST depression of 0.6.
    Dra. Lee  said that patient302 is fresh like a daisy, because
        has normal blood flow, and
        has non-anginal pain, and
        has a maximum heart rate of 173, and
        has exercise-induced ST depression of 0.
    Dra. Lee said that patient3 is at the gates of heaven, because
        has normal blood flow, and
        has non-anginal pain, and
        has a maximum heart rate of 187, and
        has exercise-induced ST depression of 3.5.
    Dra. Davis  said that patient93 is fresh like a daisy, because
        has non-anginal pain, and
        has exercise-induced ST depression of 0.6, and
        has a flat ST segment during peak exercise, and
        has a normal fasting blood sugar level.
    Dra. Davis  said that patient3 is fresh like a daisy, because
        has non-anginal pain, and
        has exercise-induced ST depression of 3.5, and
        has a maximum heart rate of 187, and
        hasn`t exercise-induced angina.
    Dra. Davis said that patient118 is at the gates of heaven, because
        is asymptomatic, and
        has a maximum heart rate of 132, and
        has a reversible defect.
The global constraints hold.
